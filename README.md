# TransferLearning-DIO
This project implements transfer learning to train an accurate image classifier that classifies cat and dog

Transfer learning is a technique that uses the knowledge of one Neural network and applies it to another. Transfer learning is a form of machine learning work and an algorithm learns how to do something, by studying examples, and then applies what it's learned to new situations. In this project, transfer learning was applied to image classification tasks and compared to a neural network trained from scratch. The results show a better scenario using transfer learning, the accuracy increases from 40%-60% to 80%-90% compared to the neural network trained from scratch, and the loss from approximately 0.59 to 0.30. This result shows that transfer learning is a promised solution to known challenges in a neural network like dataset size need to train a neural network, overfitting and training time.
